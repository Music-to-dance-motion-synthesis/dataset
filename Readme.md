## Introduction

This dataset is build to create relationship between dance motion and the music, which contains four types of dance, Cha-cha, Tango, Rumba and Waltz. 

In each directory, `audio.mp3` gives the audio files of the dance. `skeletons.json` describes the skeleton points of the dance, the `config.json` gives the start frames and the end frames (The dance sequence match part of the songs). The FPS of the dataset is 25 frames per second.

## Notes
